## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A multilingual, AI-powered chatbot and mobile app that interacts via text or voice in the farmer's mother tongue.
            </li>
            <li>
                Real-time weather updates, market price alerts, and crop advisory tailored by region and farm history.
            </li>
            <li>
                Image-based pest, disease, and soil moisture detection using AI and machine learning for crop and soil health analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Automated, consent-driven price comparison and e-commerce integration for purchasing fertilizers and pesticides.

                Offline support and low-data usage design for remote areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                Escalation and direct contact features to connect to government agricultural officials for advanced assistance, inspired by customer care models.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clear consent management, privacy policies, and regular feedback collection for continuous system improvement.

  <h4>Methodology and Workflow</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Farmer initiates chat via mobile app/website in their language using voice/text.</li>
            <li>AI chatbot receives and understands the query using NLU models and provides data-driven advisory or connects to APIs for real-time weather/market prices.</li>
            <li>Farmer uploads crop or soil image for AI analysis (pest/disease/soil health detection); chatbot returns customized advice.</li>
            <li>With consent, chatbot searches and recommends agri-input deals, guiding through purchase and delivery process.</li>
            <li>When complex or unresolved issues arise, the chatbot escalates conversation to a human government official via integrated dashboard.</li>
            <li>All activity respects user consent, privacy, and security, with data stored securely on the cloud. Feedback is collected for iterative improvement.</li>
        </ol>
